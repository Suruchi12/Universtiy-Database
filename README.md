# Universtiy Database

Created a database design for a university database that is normalized to the third normal form and can correctly identify and handled one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Implemented the design in Microsoft SQL Server by loading meaningful data and created database objects such as views, stored procedures and functions.
